    <p>My favorite drink of choice is sparkling apple cider. 
    I love apple cider because it's refreshing, delicious and tastes great cold and with ice. 
    I love it when restaurants have it, and when bars have it too. It reminds me of wine but 
    it's better because it has zero alcohol. A great drink overall!
