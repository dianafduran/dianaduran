          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p class="bio">Claire Cottrill was born on August 18, 1998 in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Carlisle, Massachusetts. She is the daughter of marketing executive Geoff Cottrill. <br> Clairo suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at age 17. In 2017, she started attending ‘Syracuse University.’ She once claimed that she was "not entirely" heterosexual.</p>

          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p class="bio">Cottrill began recording covers at the age of 13. She started posting her music videos to ‘Bandcamp’, under the names ‘Clairo’ and ‘DJ Baby Benz.’ After releasing dozens of home recordings in 2013, she released her EP ‘Do U Wanna Fall in Love?’ (2014). 
            This was followed by a few more EPS in 2015, such as ‘Aquarius Boy,’ ‘Late Show, Moth Girl,’ ‘Metal Heart,’ and ‘Have a Nice Day.’ During this time, Clairo became active on ‘YouTube’ with her acoustic covers. She went on to make covers of popular songs by Alex G, Frankie Cosmos, and ‘The Cure.’ <br> Clairo first drew wide attention in late 2017 when the video for her song "Pretty Girl" went viral on YouTube. The song was recorded for an indie rock compilation benefiting the Transgender Law Center. 
            According to her, she recorded the track "using the resources around me which were pretty shitty. I used like a little keyboard that I had and I was really into ’80s pop music — my mom is obsessed with it — so it kind of inspired me to do something like that." She has attributed audience interest in the video to YouTube's algorithm system. <br>
            On May 24, 2019, Clairo released a new single, "Bags", and announced her debut album Immunity which was released on August 2, 2019. She would further release two more singles from the album "Closer to You" and "Sofia." Following the album's commercial success, Apple Music named Clairo an Up Next artist in August 2019. Clairo made her television debut performing "I Wouldn’t Ask You" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in September 2019, before performing "Bags" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show a few days later. <br>
            In February 2022, Clairo embarked on the US leg of the Sling tour, album which she released on July 16, 2021, through Fader and Republic..</p>
