        <p>I like to call green tea my "oasis" in a busy day, I love how relaxed it can make me feel, even a little bit helps improve my mood and lose the tension, 
            plus, it is also great for weight loss and healing the body naturally.

            When I get a flu, I drink green tea with agave syrup, when my head hurts, I drink some green tea as well. It has zero calories and you can add milk to it to make it creamy and tastier.

            It is a drink that has been around for many years and people have used its healing benefits for all those years, and will continue to use it for many years to come.
            <br>
            That is why I love green tea
